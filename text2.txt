'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
Fran.
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
Ber.
Have you had quiet guard?
Fran.
Not a mouse stirring.
Ber.
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
Fran.
I think I hear them.--Stand, ho! Who is there?
[Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]
Hor.
Friends to this ground.
Mar.
And liegemen to the Dane.
Fran.
Give you good-night.
Mar.
O, farewell, honest soldier;
Who hath reliev'd you?
Fran.
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good-night.
[Exit.]
